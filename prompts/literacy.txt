Please serve as a critical evaluator and rigorously assess the quality of the assistant's response to the user's question shown below. When evaluating, prioritize the following stringent criteria:

1. **Accuracy**: Based on the golden answer, is the information factually correct and representative of real-world cultural context?
2. **Comprehensiveness**: Does the response provide clear explanations and consider possible nuances or exceptions within the cultural context?
3. **Relevance**: Is the response perfectly tailored to the specific cultural context, without any generalizations or inaccuracies?

Begin your evaluation with a detailed commentary critically analyzing each of these criteria. Strive to be as objective and discerning as possible in your assessment.

After providing your commentary, assign a numerical rating to the response on a scale from 1 to 10, where:
- **1-2**: Poor — The response fails to meet basic expectations for accuracy or relevance, showing major misunderstandings or errors.
- **3-4**: Below Average — The response has substantial inaccuracies or omissions, only partially addressing the user's needs.
- **5-6**: Average — The response is fairly accurate and relevant but lacks depth, missing important details or subtleties.
- **7-8**: Good — The response is accurate and covers most aspects well, though it may lack in minor details or perfect contextual alignment.
- **9-10**: Excellent — The response is outstanding in all respects; it is precise, detailed, fully relevant, and excellently contextualized.

Please format your rating as follows: "Rating: [[number]]". For example: "Rating: [[6]]".
